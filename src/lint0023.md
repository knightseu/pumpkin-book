# Description
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, please return all subsequences of string in the dict.

If we can delete some char from a string s to get string t, we will say t is the subsequence of s.

The length of s is no more than 1\,0001000.

The number of words in the dict is no more than 1\,0001000 and the total length of these words in dict is no more than 1\,0001000.

All the strings only contain lowercase letters.

# Example
## Example 1:

Input："lintcode"，["de","ding","co","code","lint"]

We can delete "lint" and "de" to get "co".
We can delete "lint" to get "code".
We can delete "code" to get "lint".
We can't get "ding" from "lintcode".
## Example 2:

Input："a"，[]

Challenge
What if the length of s is no more than 100\,000100000？
